# Online Football Manager

Disclaimer: This is a non-commercial project that I created to get a better feel for Backbone.js. No copyright infringement was intended.

##Info:

This app is a football management simulation game where users can choose a team to manage and set them up tactically for matches against other users. The users' tactics, among other things, are evaluated in a daily match (rake task) where two teams are matched up and a winner is decided. This then updates stats within the database which in turn updates statistical info on the site.

##Technologies used:
This app has a Ruby on Rails back-end with the majority of the front-end being made up of Backbone.js.

- Ruby
- Rails
- jQuery
- Underscore.js
- Backbone.js
- Chart.js
- Accounting.js (for prettified monetary amounts)
- Tablesorter.js (for league table)
- Postgres
- RSpec

##Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the help of my class mates at GA, our instructor, Joel Turnbull, and our TA, the real Jack Jeffress. Learning new techniques and fixing bugs is easier when you have more people looking at your code and helping you find improvements. Thank you all for your help.
